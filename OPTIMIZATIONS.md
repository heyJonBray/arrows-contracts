# Arrows Contract Optimizations and Fixes

I made changes to a modified [`ArrowsOptimized.sol`](src/ArrowsOptimized.sol) contract to preserve the original. I was able to get 3% gas reduction on mint with almost no change to the resulting distrubition. Don't feel obligated to implement the optimization if the resulting distrubition isn't favorable, at the end of the day this was a fun gas golf session lol

## Acounting Loophole

If the winner claims the prize before the owner claims their share `prizePool.totalDeposited` is reduced to what's left in the pool, and the owner's share is calculated as 40% of that. Owner can still use `emergencyWithdraw()` but if you want the game to continue indefinitely, you may want to update the `claimPrize()` logic to pay the owner out before resetting deposits so that in the event the game continues, accounting is up to date.

## Optimizations

Tried out a few different gas-optimizatioons and I was able to get an overall 3% reduction in `mint` cost by changing the randomness generation from the keccack256 implementation in `Utilities.sol` to bit manipulation of the seed, although for the 5th mint there was negligible reduction (<1%). Storage optimizations in structs led to additional gas savings, such as a 7% reduction in cost to check the winning token.

Full report of test of gas optimization is [here](mint-gas-report.txt).

Below are all the changes made to `ArrowsOptimized.sol`.

## State Variables

- Removed `totalPrizePool` as it was redundant with `prizePool.totalDeposited`
- moved `ownerWithdrawn` tracking into `prizePool.totalWithdrawn` for better gas efficiency and code organization, while maintaining the same withdrawal limit functionality
- updated `lastWinnerClaim` timestamp to `uint32` which still provides coverage until 2106
- put `winnerPercentage` only in PrizePool, updated to `uint8` and packed variables in PrizePool struct
  - modify castings for timestamps in `updateWinnerPercentage()` and `claimPrize()` to work with that change
  - Added public getter function for `PrizePool.winnerPercentage` for access control

```solidity
function getTotalDeposited() public view returns (uint256)
function getTotalWithdrawn() public view returns (uint256)
```

## Gas Optimizations

### `mint()`

Originally tried improving efficiency by pre-incrementing `tokenMintId` and batching storage operations but the gas results were negligible as you saw already. The modifications that did reduce gas were:

- Removed redundant `totalPrizePool` variable
- Direct bit manipulation in `_generateTokenRandomness`

### `_generateTokenRandomness()`

replaced Utilities hash with bit manipulation for gas efficiency, and it avoids a library call which helps a little. The result produces different outputs given the same seed, but is scaled match the original color and gradient distributions. There is a slight skew over a large amount of test mints in some of the color bands which you can see below.

> Ran a simulation of 1000 mints to get the distribution of color bands and gradients between the original and optimized versions here: [`randomness-simulation.txt`](randomness-simulation.txt). This was generated from `ArrowsRandomnessSimulation.t.sol`.

5 | 2.90% | 2.70%
6 | 2.80% | 3.10%
```

## Arrows.t.sol

Fixed the failing tests for `testEmergencyWithdraw` and `testWithdrawOwnerShare`. The problem is that the test contract was set as the owner instead of a simulated deployer. Made the following changes to the test file:

- init with proper owner (`vm.addr(1)`) instead of the contract itself
- check balance against `_owner.balance` instead of `address(this).balance` in `testWithdrawOwnerShare()` and properly deconstruct the `prizePool` when checking for the owner's share
- remove redundant ownership transfer in `testEmergencyWithdraw()` since owner was set previously
- Updated `Arrows.sol` with a getter function for winner percentage

Tests are now passing.
